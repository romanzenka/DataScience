# What is Docker


"Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in." [1](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)


**VM?**

> Containers present a lower system overhead than Virtual Machines and performance of the application inside a container is generally same or better as compared to the same application running within a Virtual Machine [2](http://devops.com/2014/11/24/docker-vs-vms/)
